Relativity

I couldn't find a good resource out there, so this is something I've mixed up quickly. I think most people think relativity is hard but there's no reason we can't explore some of the concepts.

Some people suggest that relativity describes that space-time has curvature!

of course, to understand motion, it might be easier to start with kinematics
