**About**: This mix's custom take on level 2 physics. We'll start with waves because they're super important.

Relativity
==========

I couldn't find a good resource out there, so this is something I've mixed up quickly. I think most people think relativity is hard but there's no reason we can't explore some of the concepts.

Woah!!  here's what that describes

Some people suggest that relativity describes that space-time has curvature!

of course, to understand motion, it might be easier to start with kinematics
