+[why check in?]()

Leave 30 seconds to 2 minutes for each person in your meeting. 
You might like to tell everyone that we're going to arrive by doing a 'round', where people will be checking in, then get into the going over the agenda.

Provide a loose guide for what people could include in their check-in. Popular examples are: 

- How's your day been ? 
- What's the highlight of your week been ? 
- What do you hope to get out of this meeting ? 

You might like to invite people to answer one or two such questions.
